**Generate an NTMT App - NextJS, TypeScript, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS quickly using this boilerplate.**

An easy to use boilerplate contains ready-to-go Next project, containing a MongoDB Driver, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS support.
You can also add testing with cypress (jest included out of the box).

No useless premade code/components! Just start writing your app instantly âš¡

## Usage

**Please make sure you have Node installed on your machine.**
```sh
npx create-ntmt-app my-app
cd my-app
```

If you are using older versions of npm (5.2 or less), you cannot utilize [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b).
Use this approach instead:

```sh
npm install -g create-ntmt-app
create-ntmt-app my-app
cd my-app
```

If you want cypress support for testing, add the "with-cypress" flag to the command, after the app name:
```sh
npx create-ntmt-app my-app with-cypress
cd my-app
```

## Additional Features
The boilerplate contains testing capabilities, as shown, using cypress and jest to maximize Unit and Integration testing. I have included the [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test) to allow for cypress testing while running the dev server.

The boilerplate contains the [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) package to allow merging tailwind classes, which I found really useful.

The boilerplate contains a predefined MongoDB driver which exports a clientPromise that can be shared across the entire app in order to access the database. The driver can be found under `lib/mongodb.ts`.

[next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) support might be added in the near future to the boilerplate since I use it quite often.

## Get Started
This is the structure of the project you will be getting:

```
my-app
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mongodb.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _app.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vercel.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ styles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ globals.css
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.local
â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc.json
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ next-env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ next.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ postcss.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ yarn.lock
```

With cypress, you will also be getting:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ cypress
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ e2e
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.cy.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ example.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ support
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commands.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ e2e.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ cypress.config.ts
```

You can start building your app as you would with [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app).

To get started with MongoDB, add your MongoDB url in MONGODB_URI environemntal variable at `.env.local`:
```
MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_url>
```
